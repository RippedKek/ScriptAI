Answer to the question no-1a:
Madelung’s deformity is a congenital or developmental deformity of the wrist that results from premature closure or defective growth of the ulnar (medial) half of the distal radial physis (growth plate). The radial growth becomes asymmetrical—while the lateral part continues to grow, the medial part does not—causing the distal radius to tilt forward and toward the ulna. Consequently, the ulna becomes prominent dorsally, and the hand and carpus deviate toward the ulnar and volar sides.

The deformity may be idiopathic or associated with genetic and syndromic conditions such as Turner’s syndrome, Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, or multiple hereditary exostosis.

Clinical features include:

Wrist deformity with dorsal prominence of the ulnar head.

Pain and limitation of wrist movement, especially pronation and supination.

Shortened forearm with radial bowing.

Radiographic findings:

Increased volar and ulnar tilt of the distal radial articular surface.

Triangular configuration of the carpus.

Dorsal subluxation of the distal ulna.

Management:
Mild cases are treated conservatively with physiotherapy and splinting. Severe or symptomatic cases may require corrective osteotomy of the radius or epiphysiodesis to restore wrist alignment.

Answer to the question no-1b:
The carpal bones are eight small bones arranged in two transverse rows, forming the skeleton of the wrist (carpus).

Proximal row (lateral to medial):

Scaphoid – boat-shaped bone articulating with the radius.

Lunate – moon-shaped bone, also articulates with the radius.

Triquetrum – pyramidal bone articulating with the articular disc and hamate.

Pisiform – pea-shaped sesamoid bone within the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris.

Distal row (lateral to medial):

Trapezium – articulates with the first metacarpal (thumb).

Trapezoid – articulates with the second metacarpal.

Capitate – the largest carpal bone, articulating with the third metacarpal.

Hamate – has a hook-like process (hamulus) on its palmar surface, articulates with the fourth and fifth metacarpals.

These bones together form the carpal arch, providing flexibility and strength to the wrist and forming the floor and sides of the carpal tunnel, through which the median nerve and flexor tendons pass.

Answer to the question no-2a:
The biceps brachii muscle has two heads of origin:

Long head: from the supraglenoid tubercle of the scapula (through the shoulder joint and intertubercular groove).

Short head: from the coracoid process of the scapula.

The fibers unite to form a single belly, which inserts into the posterior rough part of the radial tuberosity and also gives off the bicipital aponeurosis, which blends with the deep fascia of the forearm medially.

Nerve supply: Musculocutaneous nerve (C5, C6).

Actions:

Flexion of the elbow joint – the main flexor of the forearm, especially when the forearm is supinated.

Supination of the forearm – acts as the most powerful supinator when the elbow is flexed.

Flexion of the shoulder joint – assists in forward flexion of the arm.

Stabilization of the shoulder joint – the long head helps keep the head of the humerus in the glenoid cavity.

The biceps is most effective as a supinator when the elbow is at 90° flexion, as seen in activities like turning a doorknob or using a screwdriver.

Answer to the question no-2b:
Polydactyly is a congenital anomaly characterized by the presence of more than five digits on one or both hands or feet. It results from a disturbance in the patterning of digital rays during limb bud development, usually between the 6th and 8th weeks of intrauterine life.

It may be hereditary (autosomal dominant) or sporadic, and sometimes associated with syndromes such as Ellis–van Creveld syndrome, trisomy 13 (Patau syndrome), or Laurence–Moon–Biedl syndrome.

Types of polydactyly:

Preaxial polydactyly – extra digit on the radial (thumb) or tibial (great toe) side.

Postaxial polydactyly – extra digit on the ulnar (little finger) or fibular (little toe) side (most common type).

Central polydactyly – extra digit between normal digits (least common).

Clinical presentation:

The extra digit may be a small skin tag, partially developed, or a complete finger with bone and joint.

It may cause cosmetic issues or interfere with normal grasping and function.

Management:
Surgical excision is the treatment of choice, usually performed during infancy or early childhood to achieve better cosmetic and functional outcomes. Reconstruction may be required when the extra digit shares tendons or nerves with the normal finger. Genetic counseling is advised if there is a family history or syndromic association.
