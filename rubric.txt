Answer to the question no-1a:
Madelung’s deformity is a congenital or developmental deformity of the wrist that results from premature closure or defective growth of the ulnar (medial) half of the distal radial physis (growth plate). The radial growth becomes asymmetrical—while the lateral part continues to grow, the medial part does not—causing the distal radius to tilt forward and toward the ulna. Consequently, the ulna becomes prominent dorsally, and the hand and carpus deviate toward the ulnar and volar sides.

The deformity may be idiopathic or associated with genetic and syndromic conditions such as Turner’s syndrome, Leri-Weill dyschondrosteosis, or multiple hereditary exostosis.

Clinical features include:

Wrist deformity with dorsal prominence of the ulnar head.

Pain and limitation of wrist movement, especially pronation and supination.

Shortened forearm with radial bowing.

Radiographic findings:

Increased volar and ulnar tilt of the distal radial articular surface.

Triangular configuration of the carpus.

Dorsal subluxation of the distal ulna.

Management:
Mild cases are treated conservatively with physiotherapy and splinting. Severe or symptomatic cases may require corrective osteotomy of the radius or epiphysiodesis to restore wrist alignment.

Answer to the question no-1b:
The carpal bones are eight small bones arranged in two transverse rows, forming the skeleton of the wrist (carpus).

Proximal row (lateral to medial):

Scaphoid – boat-shaped bone articulating with the radius.

Lunate – moon-shaped bone, also articulates with the radius.

Triquetrum – pyramidal bone articulating with the articular disc and hamate.

Pisiform – pea-shaped sesamoid bone within the tendon of flexor carpi ulnaris.

Distal row (lateral to medial):

Trapezium – articulates with the first metacarpal (thumb).

Trapezoid – articulates with the second metacarpal.

Capitate – the largest carpal bone, articulating with the third metacarpal.

Hamate – has a hook-like process (hamulus) on its palmar surface, articulates with the fourth and fifth metacarpals.

These bones together form the carpal arch, providing flexibility and strength to the wrist and forming the floor and sides of the carpal tunnel, through which the median nerve and flexor tendons pass.
