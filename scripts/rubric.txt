Answer to the question no-1a
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is a network-layer protocol used to identify and locate hosts and to route packets across IP networks. It uses 32-bit addresses written in dotted-decimal notation (e.g., 192.168.1.1). IP networks are packet-switched: data is segmented into independent packets that may take different paths. The 32-bit space provides about 4.29 billion unique addresses; scarcity of globally routable IPv4 space helped motivate the adoption of IPv6.

Answer to the question no-1b
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the successor to IPv4, using 128-bit addresses (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334) to provide a vastly larger address space. It streamlines routing with a simpler base header, supports stateless address autoconfiguration (SLAAC), and mandates IPsec as “implemented” (not necessarily used). Other improvements include efficient extension headers and built-in neighbor discovery to replace ARP.
End of Answer-1b

Answer to the question no-1c
The IPv4 header contains: Version, IHL (header length), DSCP/ECN, Total Length, Identification, Flags, Fragment Offset, TTL, Protocol, Header Checksum, Source Address, Destination Address, and optional Options (with Padding). The minimum header is 20 bytes (IHL=5); options extend it in 4-byte words. TTL prevents routing loops by decrementing per hop; Protocol indicates the upper-layer (e.g., 6=TCP, 17=UDP).

Answer to the question no-2a
The OSI model has 7 layers: Physical, Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, and Application. Data is encapsulated as it moves down the stack and decapsulated on receipt. Security is provided by protocols across layers (e.g., IPsec at Layer 3, TLS near Layers 5–7) rather than by a separate “security layer.”
End of Answer-2a

Answer to the question no-2b
TCP is connection-oriented and reliable: it uses a three-way handshake, sequence numbers, acknowledgments, retransmissions, flow control, and congestion control to deliver an ordered byte stream. UDP is connectionless and best-effort: it preserves message boundaries, adds minimal overhead, and offers no built-in reliability or ordering—useful for DNS, VoIP, and real-time media where timeliness may be preferred over reliability.
End of Answer-2b

Answer to the question no-2c
A /26 network has 64 total addresses and 62 usable host addresses. Example: 192.168.10.0/26 spans 192.168.10.0–192.168.10.63; the network address is .0, first usable .1, last usable .62, and broadcast .63. The dotted-decimal mask for /26 is 255.255.255.192.
End of Answer-2c

Answer to the question no-3a
ARP resolves IPv4 addresses to MAC addresses on a local network. A host broadcasts an ARP Request asking “Who has IP X?”; the owner replies with its MAC address, and entries are cached for a short time. Gratuitous ARP announces/updates mappings; ARP poisoning is a known attack that forges replies to redirect traffic.

Answer to the question no-3b
DHCP automatically provides IP configuration using UDP (server port 67, client port 68). The DORA process is: Discover (client broadcast), Offer (server), Request (client), Acknowledgment (server). Leases typically include IP address, subnet mask/prefix, default gateway, DNS servers, and lease time; renewals occur before expiry.
End of Answer-3b

Answer to the question no-3c
DNS maps human-readable names to IP addresses. A resolver (often on the client’s OS or a recursive server) queries authoritative sources, possibly contacting root, TLD, and domain name servers. Most queries use UDP/53; TCP/53 is used for zone transfers and truncated/large responses. Caching with TTLs reduces latency and query load.

Answer to the question no-4a
Wi-Fi (802.11) uses CSMA/CA (collision avoidance) with carrier sensing and randomized backoff; it cannot detect collisions while transmitting. Classic shared-medium Ethernet on hubs used CSMA/CD (collision detection), but modern switched full-duplex Ethernet eliminates collisions.
End of Answer-4a

Answer to the question no-4b
The TCP three-way handshake: the client sends SYN with its initial sequence number (ISN); the server replies with SYN-ACK (acknowledging the client’s ISN and providing its own); the client sends ACK acknowledging the server’s ISN. After this, the connection is established and data transfer begins using sequence and acknowledgment numbers.
End of Answer-4b

Answer to the question no-4c
TCP congestion control typically follows: Slow Start (cwnd grows exponentially until ssthresh), then Congestion Avoidance (additive increase). On triple-duplicate ACKs, Fast Retransmit triggers, and Fast Recovery adjusts cwnd without dropping to one segment (variant-dependent). On timeout, cwnd is reduced drastically (multiplicative decrease) and Slow Start resumes. Algorithms (e.g., Reno, CUBIC) define exact behaviors.

Answer to the question no-5a
NAT translates private internal addresses to public addresses. Static NAT maps one-to-one; dynamic NAT maps from a pool; PAT (NAPT) multiplexes many internal hosts onto one public IP via distinct port mappings. NAT conserves IPv4 space but breaks some end-to-end assumptions; helpers like port-forwarding, ALG, UPnP, or STUN/TURN are often needed.
End of Answer-5a

Answer to the question no-5b
VLANs logically segment Layer-2 broadcast domains using 802.1Q tags. Access ports carry one VLAN to endpoints; trunk ports carry multiple VLANs between switches (and to routers). Inter-VLAN communication requires Layer-3 routing (router-on-a-stick or L3 switch). VLANs improve isolation, security, and broadcast containment.
End of Answer-5b

Answer to the question no-5c
CIDR uses prefix lengths (e.g., /24) instead of fixed classes and supports route aggregation. Example: 10.0.0.0/20 summarizes 10.0.0.0/24 through 10.0.15.0/24 into one aggregate. Prefix length denotes how many high-order bits are network bits; remaining bits are for hosts/subnets.
End of Answer-5c

Answer to the question no-6a
HTTPS is HTTP over TLS. In TLS 1.3, the client and server negotiate parameters, perform an ephemeral key exchange (e.g., ECDHE) for forward secrecy, authenticate the server via its certificate, derive shared keys, and then protect application data with symmetric encryption and integrity. Optional client authentication may also be configured.
End of Answer-6a

Answer to the question no-6b
802.11n operates in 2.4 GHz and 5 GHz with up to 40 MHz channels and multiple spatial streams; throughput depends on MCS, channel width, and stream count. 802.11ac operates primarily at 5 GHz, supports wider channels (up to 160 MHz), higher-order modulation, and more streams, providing substantially higher throughput than 802.11n.
End of Answer-6b

Answer to the question no-6c
QoS classifies and marks traffic (e.g., DSCP) so devices can queue and schedule it appropriately. Techniques include strict-priority or weighted fair queuing, traffic shaping (smooths bursts) and policing (drops/exceeds rate). Proper QoS reduces latency and jitter for delay-sensitive flows like voice and interactive video.
