Answer to the question no-1a
IPv4 (Internet Protocol version 4) is a communication protocol used to identify and locate devices on a network and route traffic across the internet. It uses a 32-bit address format (e.g., 192.168.1.1) to uniquely identify each device.
IPv4 operates on a packet-switched network, where data is divided into packets and sent independently.
Since it supports about 4.3 billion unique addresses, IPv6 was later introduced to overcome this limitation.
End of Answer-1a

Answer to the question no-1b
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol designed to replace IPv4.
It uses a 128-bit address format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3::8a2e:0370:7334), allowing for a vastly larger number of unique IP addresses.
IPv6 provides improved features such as faster routing, built-in security (IPsec), and simplified address configuration.
It was developed to handle the rapid growth of internet-connected devices and overcome IPv4’s address exhaustion.
