IPv4 is the unique address of each device connected to a network. It is a 32-bit address consisting of four parts, each separated by a dot. An example of an IP address might be 192.168.0.1. It has five classes: A, B, C, D, and E. It can host 232 different devices.

Answer to the question no.1b
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol designed to replace IPv4. It uses a 128-bit address format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a3:0:0:0:0:0:1). It allows for a vastly larger number of unique IP addresses. IPv6 provides improved features such as faster routing, built-in security (IPsec), and simplified address configuration. It was developed to handle the rapid growth of internet-connected devices and overcome IPv4's address exhaustion.
