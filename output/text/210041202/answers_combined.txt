Answer to the question no-1a
IPv4 is the unique address of each device connected to a network. It is a 32-bit address consisting of four parts, each separated by a dot. An example of an IP address might be 192.168.0.1. It has five classes: A, B, C, D and E. It can host 232 different devices.
End of answer-1a

Answer to the question no-1b
IPv6 (Internet Protocol version 6) is the latest version of the Internet Protocol designed to replace IPv4.
It uses a 128-bit address format (e.g., 2001:0db8:85a2:0370:7334), allowing for a vastly larger number of unique IP addresses.
IPv6 provides improved features such as faster routing, built-in security (IPsec), and simplified address configuration.
It was developed to handle the rapid growth of internet-connected devices and overcome IPv4's address exhaustion.

Answer to the question no-1c
IPv4 headers include fields like Version, HUL, DSCP/ECN, Total Length, Identification, Flags/Fragment Offset, TTL, Protocol, Header Checksum, Source and Destination addresses, and optional Options. Typical minimum header size is 20 bytes, options can extend it in 4-byte increments. TTL prevents looping. Protocol identifies the upper-layer (eg. 6-TCP, 17-UUDP).

Answer to the question no-2a
The OSI model has 7 layers. Physical Data Link, Network, Transport, Session, Presentation, Application, and Security. Each layer adds headers and the Security layer encrypts everything below it universally.
End of answer-2a

Answer to the question no-2b
TCP is connection-oriented and reliable (3-way handshake, sequencing, ACKs, retransmissions, flow and congestion control). UDP is connectionless

and best-effort with lower overhead and latency, often used for real-time traffic (VoIP, gaming, DNS). TCP ensures ordered delivery. UDP may arrive out of order or be dropped.

Answer to the question no-2c
A 126 subnet mask has 64 total addresses and 62 usable. Example: 192.168.100.26 ranges from 0 to 63, with 0 network and .63 broadcast. Subnet masks in dotted decimal for 126 is 255.255.255.192. (No calculation shown for other masks.)

Answer to the question no-3a
ARP maps IP to MAC addresses on a local LAN. A host broadcasts an ARP Request for an IP, the owner replies with its MAC. Entries are cached and time out. Gratuitous ARP can update peers, and ARP poisoning is a known attack vector.
End of answer-3a

Answer to the question no-3b
DHCP assigns IP configuration automatically. The server communicates
over TCP ports 67/68 using a four-step process: Discover, Offer, Request.
Ack. If it can also hand out DNS servers and default gateway.
End of answer-3b

Answer to the question no-3c
DNS translates names to IP addresses. Typical queries go to a resolver,
which can be recursive and may consult root, TLD, and authoritative servers.
Most lookups use UDP/53, large zone transfers may use TCP.

Answer to the question no-4a
WiFi uses CSMA/CD to detect collisions on the air and then backs
off. Ethernet also uses CSMA/CD but only on hubs, modern switches
eliminate collisions entirely.
End of answer-4a

Answer to the question no-4b

The TCP three-way handshake, SYN (client → server) to propose initial sequence number, SYNACK (server → client) acknowledging and proposing its own, then ACK (client → server). After this, data flows with established sequence/ACK numbers.
End of answer-4b

Answer to the question no-4c

TCP congestion control phases include Slow Start (exponential growth), Congestion Avoidance (additive increase), Fast Retransmit/Fast Recovery on triple-duplicate ACKs, and multiplicative decrease on loss. Algorithms like Reno/CUBIC tune these behaviors.
End of answer-4c

Answer to the question no-5a

NAT translates private addresses to a public address (or pool), PAT (NAPT) multiplexes many internal flows onto one public IP using distinct port mappings. This conserves IPv4 space but breaks end-to-end reachability unless assisted (e.g., port forwards, UPnP, SSHN).

Answer to the question no-5b
VANs segment Layer-2 domains logically using 802.1Q tags, improving isolation and broadcast containment. Trunk links carry multiple VANS between switches, access ports carry a single VAN to endpoints. Inter- VAN routing is done by a router or L3 switch.
End of Answer-5b

Answer to the question no-5c
CIDR uses masks like 255.255.0.0/24 to summarize multiple networks. For example, 100.0.0/20 groups 16 networks of 128 each.
End of Answer-5c

Answer to the question no-6a
HTTPS wraps HTTP in TLS/SA typical TLS 1.3 handshake negotiates ciphers, exchanges ephemeral keys (ECDHE), authenticates the server via its certificate, derives shared secrets, and then encrypts application data with forward secrecy.

End of answer-6a
Answer to the question no-6b
802.11ac operates primarily at 2.4 GHz and reaches up to 1 Gbps per stream. 802.11n is only 5 GHz and limited to 150 Mbps total. Channel bonding and MIMO are optional.
End of answer-6b
Answer to the question no-6c
DoS marks packets (eg., DSCP) so queues can prioritize delay-sensitive traffic. Schedulers like strict priority or WFO allocate bandwidth, shaping and policing control rates. (No specific DSCP values provided.)
