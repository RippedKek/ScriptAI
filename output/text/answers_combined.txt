Answer to the question no-1a:

Madelung's deformity is a developmental abnormality of the wrist joint that mainly affects the distal end of the radius bone. It occurs when the growth of the ulnar part of the distal radial physis (the growth plate) is disturbed or permanently closed, while the remaining part of the bone continues to grow normally. As a result, the distal radius becomes abnormally curved and shortened on its medial side, which causes the wrist and hand to deviate toward the ulna. The deformity is usually more noticeable during adolescence when growth is rapid. In this condition, the ulna often becomes prominent

and the hand appears to be tilted
toward the little finger side. The exact
cause can be idiopathic, but it may also
be linked with certain genetic and
congenital conditions like Turner's
syndrome, dyschondrosteosis, or trauma
to the growth plate during childhood.
Clinically, patients may present with
pain at the wrist, restriction of
movement (especially pronation and
supination), and a visible deformity.
